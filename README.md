# CoolKeys
Testing chrome's MIDI devices input capabilities, this version supports playing from a regular keyboard, but should also support playing from a midi device.<br/>
If a MIDI device is connected, it would be able to use it to play the tone generator.<br/><br/>
This version contains an experimental sample player, note that notes are fetched first after pressing the note, so using this online might not be optimal atm.
