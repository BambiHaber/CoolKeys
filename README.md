# CoolKeys
Testing chrome's MIDI devices input capabilities, this version supports playing from a regular keyboard, but should also support playing from a midi device.<br/>
If a MIDI device is connected, it would be able to use it to play the tone generator.<br/><br/>
This version contains an experimental sample player, note that notes are fetched first after pressing the note, so using this online might not be optimal atm.

 on the 28 Aug 2015 - This project used to run on Chrome Canary, as a test at times when MIDI support was experimental and css animations needed a bit of improvments, I enjoyed very much doing this, working at the time for an Audio Company.
 
 I belive the next step would be able to use this GUI an AudioAPI and MIDIAccess for VST/AU plugins, it is an interesting project - which if somebody is interested please get in touch so there can finally be a way for creating VSTI instruments and AU plugins based more on Web technologies which are as of now are mature enough to provide us with amazing results.
